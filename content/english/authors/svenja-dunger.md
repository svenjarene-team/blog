Hello! I’m Svenja, originally from Bavaria and now living in Berlin. I’m studying Business Informatics at HTW Berlin. My interest in technology began with a challenging three-month web development bootcamp, which opened my eyes to the world of coding. Since then, I’ve been working on improving my skills, especially in network systems and IT security.

I developed a love for learning languages and understanding different cultures. I’m currently learning Spanish and Arabic to broaden my horizons and connect with more people.

In my free time, I enjoy working on small coding projects and exploring the intersection of technology and social good. I’m dedicated to learning and growing, both personally and professionally, in this fascinating field.
