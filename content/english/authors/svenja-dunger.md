Hello! I'm Svenja, originally from Bavaria and now living in Berlin. As a Computational Linguistics student at the University of Potsdam, I combine my passion for languages with my love for technology. My journey into tech began with a web development bootcamp, which sparked my interest in coding and led me to explore the intersection of language and computer science.
When I'm not studying or coding, I enjoy learning new languages and exploring different cultures. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to grow and create meaningful impact through technology.
