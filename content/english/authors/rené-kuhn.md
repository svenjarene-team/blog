 Hello! I'm René, originally from Bavaria and now living in Berlin. My journey into the world of IT began about five years ago when I discovered my passion for programming through various projects and collaborations.

After moving to Berlin, I met an IT administrator who introduced me to Linux and open-source software. This newfound interest led me to attend conferences like Nextcloud and KubeCon, further deepening my technical knowledge. My experiences have taken me to tech hubs in India and China, enriching my understanding of global software development.

Currently, I work as a Golang backend developer at Terramate. My role here, along with previous hands-on projects, has equipped me with skills in cloud infrastructure and backend systems. I’m always eager to learn more and grow professionally, with a particular interest in cybersecurity and machine learning.
