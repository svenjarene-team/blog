Hello! I'm René, originally from Bavaria and now living in Berlin. I'm currently studying IT Systems Engineering at the Hasso Plattner Institute while working as an Infrastructure and Cloud Operations Engineer in their data center. My journey into tech began with a passion for programming and open-source software, which led me to attend conferences like KubeCon in China and contribute to projects like the Fedora Linux community.
When I'm not managing cloud infrastructure or studying, I enjoy organizing tech community events and exploring new technologies. I'm particularly passionate about cloud-native solutions and open-source collaboration.
