 Svenja studies Computational Linguistics at the University of Potsdam, while René pursues IT Systems Engineering at the Hasso Plattner Institute.

We both started our journeys in tech through unconventional paths. Now, we're excited to be learning and growing in our respective fields, exploring topics like natural language processing, cloud computing, and open source along the way.

Our goal is simply to keep learning, to support each other, and to one day use our skills to make a positive difference, however small. We're just two ordinary people following our passions, and we're grateful for every opportunity that comes our way.
